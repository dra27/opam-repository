synopsis: "OCaml with un-typed effects surface syntax"
description: """
Virtual package installed by OCaml compilers that support the OCaml Multicore
project's surface syntax for effect declarations and handling. Primary purpose
is to allow old packages which require the syntax to depend on it and also
packages which are incompatible with the syntax changes to conflict with it.
