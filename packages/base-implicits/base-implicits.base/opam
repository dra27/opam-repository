synopsis: "OCaml with modular implicits surface syntax"
description: """
Virtual package installed by OCaml compilers that support modular implicits.
Primary purpose is to allow packages which are incompatible with the syntax
changes (typically because 'implicit' is used as an identifier) to conflict
with it."""
